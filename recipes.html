        <h2>High-Protein Recipes Using Slate Milk</h2>
        <p>Whether you’re powering up for a workout, looking for a mid-day pick-me-up, or just want something deliciously nutritious, Slate Milk is your go-to base for easy, high-protein recipes. Our ultra-filtered, lactose-free chocolate milk is more than just a drink—it’s a versatile ingredient that levels up your health game.</p>
        <p>Let’s dive into some creative, protein-packed recipes you can make with your favorite Slate flavors.</p>

        <h2>Chocolate Milk Recipe Ideas</h2>
        <p>There's something nostalgic and comforting about chocolate milk—but with Slate, it’s leveled up with protein and clean ingredients. Try a <strong>Chocolate Banana Recovery Shake</strong> by blending:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>1 can Slate Classic Chocolate</li>
          <li>1 ripe banana</li>
          <li>1 tbsp peanut butter</li>
          <li>1 scoop chocolate protein powder</li>
          <li>Handful of ice</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This smoothie clocks in at over 35g of protein and is perfect post-workout or as a meal replacement.</p>

        <h2>Protein-Packed Smoothies</h2>
        <p>Smoothies are the fastest way to get nutrients and protein in your day. Thanks to Slate Milk’s creamy texture and sweet-but-clean taste, it blends seamlessly into nearly every smoothie. Try the <strong>Blueberry Power Smoothie</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>1 can Slate French Vanilla</li>
          <li>½ cup frozen blueberries</li>
          <li>½ cup Greek yogurt</li>
          <li>1 scoop vanilla protein</li>
          <li>1 tbsp chia seeds</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Blend until smooth. Great for breakfast or pre-workout fuel!</p>

        <h2>Post-Workout Protein Shakes</h2>
        <p>After a heavy lift session or cardio run, your body craves recovery fuel. Enter the <strong>Mocha Muscle Shake</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>1 can Slate Mocha Latte</li>
          <li>1 shot espresso (optional)</li>
          <li>1 scoop chocolate whey or vegan protein</li>
          <li>Ice</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This shake delivers a caffeine kick and muscle-building power in under 2 minutes.</p>

        <h2>Hot Chocolate with Protein</h2>
        <p>Nothing hits like a cozy hot chocolate after a winter workout or during a study break. Instead of sugary powders, try heating up a can of Slate Classic Chocolate, then whisk in:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>1 scoop collagen or unflavored protein powder</li>
          <li>Dash of cinnamon or cayenne</li>
          <li>Mini marshmallows if you’re feeling festive</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Boom—comfort meets function.</p>

        <h2>Overnight Oats with Slate Milk</h2>
        <p>Overnight oats are great for meal prep, and Slate Milk makes them taste like dessert. Try <strong>Chocolate Protein Overnight Oats</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>½ cup oats</li>
          <li>1 tbsp cocoa powder</li>
          <li>1 scoop chocolate protein</li>
          <li>¾ can Slate Classic Chocolate</li>
          <li>Toppings: peanut butter, berries, dark chocolate chips</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Combine all ingredients in a jar and refrigerate overnight. Grab and go in the morning!</p>

        <h2>Mocha and Coffee-Based Drinks</h2>
        <p>Craving that iced mocha vibe but want to skip the sugar bomb? Mix up this <strong>Iced Mocha Protein Latte</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>1 can Slate Mocha Latte (cold)</li>
          <li>1 scoop chocolate or mocha protein</li>
          <li>Shake in a blender bottle with ice</li>
          <li>Pour over ice and top with oat milk or whipped cream</li>
        </ul>
        <p>It’s energizing, filling, and far healthier than coffee shop versions.</p>

        <h2>Bonus Ideas</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Protein Popsicles using Slate + Greek yogurt</li>
          <li>Baked protein brownies with Slate instead of milk</li>
          <li>High-protein chia pudding with Slate Vanilla</li>
          <li>Protein pancakes using Slate as a milk substitute</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Why Use Slate Milk in Recipes?</h2>
        <p>Slate isn’t just lactose-free and ultra-filtered. It’s a smart choice for recipes because:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>It adds 20g of protein per can</li>
          <li>It's shelf-stable and travel-ready</li>
          <li>It has no added sugar (depending on flavor)</li>
          <li>It blends better than traditional milk or powders</li>
        </ul>
